### MVP
- JamPack'd is a music discovery app that will create a playlist based on randomly generated music that you can like or dislike.
- You need an account to use this app.
- If you dislike a song, the song will not be added to the playlist.
- If you like the song, the song will be added to a playlist for you that you can view after you're finished making your selections. 
- Created playlists can be viewed from Home Page-Logged In.
